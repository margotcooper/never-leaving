Hitting the Town APP README

Description: An application on the web that allows a user to search events around San Diego, including sports, music, bars and restaurants.

Motivation: we wanted to make it easier for a local or tourist to find events around them in order to enjoy their nights out.

User stories: As a funseeker living in/visiting San Diego, I want to be able to see events going on around me, so that I have something fun to do. As a Hitting the Town user, I want to specify what types of events/locations that will show, so that I can customize my results.

Direction for Future Dev: In the future, we planned for this application to expand to other major cities. Also, more APIs could be used to get additional data on other types of events to populate to display to the user. Additional modification could also be implemented to further refine searches, allowing users to personalize even more which types of activities they would like to see in their results.
